about: "While there isn't a single, centralized organization specifically named 'United for Mahsa,' the phrase encapsulates the global movement ignited by the tragic death of Mahsa Amini in Iran on September 16, 2022. This movement calls for justice for Mahsa, an end to the mandatory hijab law, and broader human rights and political reforms in Iran."
expertise: "A non-partisan social activist group bringing human rights issues in Iran to the fore in sociopolitical discourses."
