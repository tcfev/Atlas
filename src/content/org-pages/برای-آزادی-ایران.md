about: "seems to be related to the ongoing protests and movement for freedom and human rights in Iran, with a focus on the Turkish perspective or support from Turkey.                                                                                                                           The Turkish people and government have shown significant support for the Iranian protests, with many Turkish citizens participating in demonstrations and expressing solidarity online. This phrase likely reflects that sentiment and highlights the transnational nature of the movement for freedom in Iran."
