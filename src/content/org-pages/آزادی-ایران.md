about: "We are a volunteer-led, global grassroots network echoing and amplifying the voices of the Iranian people working to support change, freedom, equality and fundamental human rights in Iran. Our 40-year movement represents the struggle of Iranian people living in and outside of Iran to create a just and peaceful future.  We believe in the principles outlined in NCRI’s President-elect Maryam Rajavi’s 10-Point Plan for the Future of Iran and that democracy in Iran is the pathway to security and stability in the Middle East.Through our collective action and steadfast commitment to our cause, we continue to grow in numbers and unite the international community behind all those fighting for freedom, democracy and equality in Iran."
