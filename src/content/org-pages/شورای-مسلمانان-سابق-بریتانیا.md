about: "Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain (CEMB) was formed in 2007 to break the taboo that comes with leaving Islam, highlight the plight of ex-Muslims and challenge Sharia laws.CEMB fights for the right to leave and criticise Islam without fear and intimidation. This is particularly important given that blasphemy, apostasy and atheism are punishable by death in a dozen countries under Islamic laws.CEMB stands against all forms of bigotry, xenophobia, racism and extremism and unequivocally defends reason, freedom of conscience and expression, equality, universal rights and secularism."
